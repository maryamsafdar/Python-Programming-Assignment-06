# Student Database Management

## Overview

This Python program allows users to manage a simple student database. Users can add new students, check for duplicates, and generate a sequential ID for each student. The program stores each student's name and ID in a tuple and keeps these tuples in a list. After the input process ends, the program displays the full list of students, their IDs, and various statistics about the student names.

## Features

- **Add Students**: Input student names and have them stored with a unique sequential ID.
- **Duplicate Check**: Automatically checks for duplicate names before adding a new student.
- **Stop Input Process**: Allows the user to stop the input process by typing "stop".
- **Display Student List**: Shows the complete list of students with their IDs.
- **Statistics**: Provides the total number of students, the total length of all student names, and identifies the student with the longest and shortest names.
